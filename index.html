<h2 style="text-align:center;"> About Me </h2>
 <p style="text-align:center;"> M Ameen Saqib, from UK, Nice to meet you :) </p>
<p>Maths has been my favourite subject since a young age.
  I found Computer Science the perfect field to explore both of my passions, maths and coding. 
  I'll be enrolling into a Computer Science degree this year. 
</p>   
   <p>
     In the past 3 years, I have been learning development. I have built multiple practice projects from YouTube.
     I had the chance to work on a national-level truck transport app project using React Native.
     Currently, I am working towards publishing my first big project in React. 
     
   </p>
   <p>
     I wish to be exposed to be the multiple fields of Computer Science. Data Analytics and AI is interesting to me
     as it requires constant learning and thinking. My ultimate goal is to be working in a field where I am constantly challenging myself and growing every day.

     I love reading books and badminton. Hoping to add learning languages.
